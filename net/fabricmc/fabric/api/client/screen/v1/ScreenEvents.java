/**
 * Holds events related to {@link class_437}s.
 *
 * <p>Some events require a screen instance in order to obtain an event instance.
 * The events that require a screen instance can be identified by the use of a method passing a screen instance.
 * All events in {@link ScreenKeyboardEvents} and {@link ScreenMouseEvents} require a screen instance.
 * This registration model is used since a screen being (re)initialized will reset the screen to its default state, therefore reverting all changes a mod developer may have applied to a screen.
 * Furthermore, this design was chosen to reduce the amount of wasted iterations of events as a mod developer would only need to register screen events for rendering, ticking, keyboards and mice if needed on a per-instance basis.
 *
 * <p>The primary entrypoint into a screen is when it is being opened, this is signified by an event {@link ScreenEvents#BEFORE_INIT before} and {@link ScreenEvents#AFTER_INIT after} initialization of the screen.
 *
 * @see Screens
 * @see ScreenKeyboardEvents

	 * An event that is called before {@link class_437#method_25423(class_310, int, int) a screen is initialized} to its default state.
	 * It should be noted some methods in {@link Screens} such as a screen's {@link class_437#method_64506 text renderer} may not be initialized yet, and as such their use is discouraged.
	 *
	 * <!--<p>Typically this event is used to register screen events such as listening to when child elements are added to the screen. ------ Uncomment when child add/remove event is added for elements-->
	 * You can still use {@link ScreenEvents#AFTER_INIT} to register events such as keyboard and mouse events.
	 *
	 * <p>The {@link ScreenExtensions} provided by the {@code info} parameter may be used to register tick, render events, keyboard, mouse, additional and removal of child elements (including buttons).
	 * For example, to register an event on inventory like screens after render, the following code could be used:
	 * <pre>{@code
	 * &#64;Override
	 * public void onInitializeClient() {
	 * 	ScreenEvents.BEFORE_INIT.register((client, screen, scaledWidth, scaledHeight) -> {
	 * 		if (screen instanceof AbstractInventoryScreen) {

	 * 				...
	 * 			});
	 * 		}
	 * 	});
	 * }
	 * }</pre>
	 *
	 * <p>This event indicates a screen has been resized, and therefore is being re-initialized.
	 * This event can also indicate that the previous screen has been changed.

	/**
	 * An event that is called after {@link class_437#method_25423(class_310, int, int) a screen is initialized} to its default state.
	 *
	 * <p>Typically this event is used to modify a screen after the screen has been initialized.
	 * Modifications such as changing sizes of buttons, removing buttons and adding/removing child elements to the screen can be done safely using this event.
	 *
	 * <p>For example, to add a button to the title screen, the following code could be used:
	 * <pre>{@code

	 * Unless the element is button, you need to call the specific {@link net.minecraft.class_4068#method_25394(class_332, int, int, float) render} methods in the corresponding screen events.
